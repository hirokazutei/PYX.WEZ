# PYX.WEZ
Pixel Visualization of Weathers!

## What is it?
It is a weather visualization JavaScript program using mostly block pixel art style. Allows you to click on places on a world map and displays the weather in the random vicinity of where you clicked (except for pre-programmed cities).


## Why it was made?

Currently switching my career goal from architecture to the realm of computer science. I gave myself a fun project to work on to practice JavaScript, work with weather & geolocation APIs, and incorporate a bit of my design skills.

If you find any bugs, or have any suggestion for the program, shoot me a message.

Pixel Visualization of Weathers!


## What the hell is it?

Well, I have it uploaded it [HERE](hirokazutei.com) (I apologize for the noobie website set-up) so check that out. It's more efficient than explaining it with text.
It is a weather visualization JavaScript program using mostly block pixel art style. Allows you to click on places on a world map and displays the weather in the random vicinity of where you clicked (except for pre-programmed cities).

I programmed it using the P5.JS library.

## Contribution

I'll write something later. Promis.

## The guy who made it.

Hey, that's me. Hi. How are you doing?
I'm currently slogging though university life somewhere in Japan, doing a master's degree that will lead me no where.


## Special Thanks.

This program isn't a big achievement like winning an Oscar or something, but I still feel strongly inclined to thank my amazing friends for generously providing me with guidance and just being cool individuals.
